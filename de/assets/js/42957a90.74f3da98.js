[inki](https://c0de111.github.io/inki/seatsurfing/) is a Community-developed software which brings live seating and room-booking data from Seatsurfing directly to your office walls \u2014 and it does so with elegance, sustainability, and very little maintenance.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What Is inki?\\n[inki](https://c0de111.github.io/inki/seatsurfing/) is a software for bare-metal systems like the Raspberry Pi Pico W, designed specifically for low-power operation. It wakes up periodically via a real-time clock (RTC), fetches data via Wi-Fi (e.g., from Seatsurfing\u2019s REST API), displays that information on an e-paper screen, and then powers itself down \u2014 all autonomously. \\n\\nThe project supports two e-paper sizes \u2014 4.2\u2033 and 7.5\u2033, allowing you to choose the form factor that best fits your space. \\nBecause e-paper retains its content even when unpowered, the display remains readable without consuming power. \\n\\n![](/img/blog/inki1.jpg)\\n\\n## Why It\u2019s a Perfect Fit for Seatsurfing\\n* Live Desk & Room Status: Once configured, inki queries your Seatsurfing server to pull the current booking status (who is sitting where, which rooms are occupied, etc.) and displays it cleanly on the screen. \\n* Browser-Based Setup: You configure inki via its own Wi-Fi access point. Point your browser to the setup page, enter your Seatsurfing API credentials (such as service account, space IDs), and you\u2019re ready to go \u2014 no cables, no USB programmers. \\n* Logo & Branding: You can even upload a custom logo or pictogram to be shown on the e-paper \u2013 making the display match your company\u2019s visual identity. \\n* Low Maintenance: Thanks to the RTC-based power control, the device can run for thousands of update cycles on simple AA or AAA batteries. \\n\\n## Key Technical Features\\n* Ultra-Low Power: Uses a DS3231 RTC and a MOSFET circuit so that the Pico W is completely unpowered between wake-ups, drawing only micro-amperes. \\n* Wireless Updates: Firmware updates are done over the air. Just connect to the inki Wi-Fi, upload the new firmware via browser, and reboot. \\n* Multiple Pages: inki supports up to 8 configurable \u201cpages\u201d that users can cycle through using onboard buttons \u2014 e.g., room occupancy, \u201cDo Not Disturb,\u201d device info, and more. \\n* Hardware & Open Source: The project provides full hardware design files (PCB, 3D-printed enclosure), firmware (C code), and documentation under open-source licenses. \\nReal-World Use Cases\\n* Room Signage: Mount inki outside meeting rooms to display real-time status (free, occupied, meeting name) pulled from Seatsurfing.\\n* Desk Sharing Boards: Use in open offices to give a live visual overview of who is sitting where.\\n* Beyond Booking: Thanks to its modular firmware, inki can be repurposed for other data-display roles \u2014 for example, visualizing live sensor data from home automation systems (e.g., Homematic/CCU Historian). \\n\\n![](/img/blog/inki2.jpg)\\n\\n## Why We Love It\\n[inki](https://c0de111.github.io/inki/seatsurfing/) embodies the principles of simplicity, efficiency, and practicality \u2014 qualities that resonate deeply with Seatsurfing\u2019s mission. By combining ultra-low power hardware with a smart software design, it creates a seamless, tangible way to connect digital booking data with physical space. inki achieves this by using the documented REST APIs provided by Seatsurfing\'s open source project. It\u2019s exactly the kind of community-driven innovation we hoped for when we open-sourced Seatsurfing.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\nIf you\u2019re interested in using inki with your Seatsurfing instance:\\n\\n1. Visit the inki project website: [c0de111.github.io/inki](https://c0de111.github.io/inki/)\\n1. Download the inki_seatsurfing.uf2 firmware from the GitHub repository. \\n1. Flash it onto a Pico W, set it up via its Wi-Fi interface, configure Seatsurfing API credentials, and select your space ID. \\n1. Insert batteries, mount the device, and enjoy a live status display that literally runs for years.\\n\\n## A Big Thanks to the Creator\\nWe\u2019d like to express our deep gratitude to [c0de111](https://github.com/c0de111) for building this neat integration. Projects like inki make the Seatsurfing ecosystem richer \u2014 they bridge the gap between the digital booking world and physical reality, in a way that feels intuitive and elegant. \u2764\ufe0f\\n\\n![](/img/blog/inki3.jpg)"},{"id":"news-october-2025","metadata":{"permalink":"/de/blog/news-october-2025","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-23-news-october-2025.md","title":"October \'25 news","description":"We\'ve been busy shipping improvements to the Seatsurfing platform over the past few weeks.

We want to make it easier for the employees of some organizations to book their seats. If you want to keep seat booking really easy, you can activate the daily basis booking functionality in the administration interface. When activated, users using the App or the Booking Web Interface just need to pick a desired date and do not need to provide a time range. The selected space is then booked for one or multiple entire days.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe second feature allows for showing the names of the colleagues having booked a space during the selected time range.
