title: Seatsurfing 1.10 replaces native apps with web app

As of July 30, 2022, the Seatsurfing mobile apps for iOS and Android will be discontinued. We decided to focus on one state-of-the-art web booking interface, which is the existing, yet improved Web Booking UI. In order to optimize the user experience of the Web Booking UI when using mobile devices (such as phones and tablets), we've turned it into a Progressive Web App (PWA). This means, you can "install" the web app to your device's home screen and benefit from enhanced caching mechanisms.
