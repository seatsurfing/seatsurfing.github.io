Everything in this new version is about groups: You can now organize your users in groups. These groups can be used as approvers for your spaces, i.e. a space admin in a space&#x27;s approver group must approve a user&#x27;s booking request before it becomes definite. Furthermore, you can use groups to restrict users who can book specific spaces, i.e. only users in an allowed group are permitted to place a booking.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/release">release</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Seatsurfing 1.32 released" href="/blog/seatsurfing-1-32-released"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/seatsurfing-1-31-released">Seatsurfing 1.31 released</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2025-05-03T00:00:00.000Z">May 3, 2025</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/virtualzone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://github.com/virtualzone.png" alt="Heiner"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/virtualzone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Heiner</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Seatsurfing Developer">Seatsurfing Developer</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>We&#x27;re happy to announce the availability of Seatsurfing version 1.31.

The biggest feature is that you can now specify custom attributes which can be attached to your locations. For example, as an administrator, you can specify whether a location is accessible with wheelchairs or what kind of media system is installed. Your users can view a location&#x27;s attributes and even filter the list of locations according to their needs.</p>

<p>Here are some of the awesome new features: You can now quickly access certain floors and spaces by direct links / QR codes. A brand-new slider allows for quickly getting an overview of the space availability in the upcoming days. Space admins can manually add and edit reservations for their users.

The move to Next.js allows for server-side rendering, resulting in faster load times. However, this leads to a breaking change, because the front ends are not shipped with the backend Docker image anymore, but in two separate containers (admin-ui and booking-ui).</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a rel="tag" class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/release">release</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Seatsurfing 1.13 released" href="/blog/seatsurfing-1-13-released"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="theme-layout-footer footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Seatsurfing</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/sign-up/">Create free account</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/pricing/">Pricing</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/">Documentation</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog/">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/support/">Support</a></li></ul></div><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Resources</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://status.seatsurfing.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Status<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/seatsurfing/seatsurfing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/seatsurfing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Docker Hub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="theme-layout-footer-column col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Legal</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/imprint/">Imprint</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/terms/">Terms</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 Seatsurfing GmbH.</div></div></div></footer></div>
