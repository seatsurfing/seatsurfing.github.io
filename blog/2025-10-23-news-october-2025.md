We've been busy shipping improvements to the Seatsurfing platform over the past few weeks. Alongside numerous bug fixes and smaller enhancements, we've rolled out several features that focus on enhancing the user experience and giving administrators more control and flexibility. Here are the most important updates:

<!-- truncate -->

**üìß Improved notification emails**

We've enhanced our booking notification emails to provide more context at a glance. Email notifications for approved, modified, or deleted bookings now include the booking subject (when available), making it easier to identify which booking the notification refers to without having to open the full details.

**üåê Localization enhancements**

The booking overview now offers more flexibility when it comes to language preferences. You can now change the localization directly within the booking overview, and we've added the ability to distinguish between British English (en-GB) and American English (en-US) formats. This ensures dates, times, and other regional formatting align with your preferences.

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Area information at your fingertips**

We've added quick access to area details in the booking overview. Simply click the area's info button to view the area's description and timezone. This makes it easier to understand the context of your bookings without navigating away from the overview.

**üîß Administrator improvements**

For organization administrators, we've rolled out several enhancements to streamline user and area management:

- First and last names for users: You can now specify first and last names for users in the system, providing better clarity in user management.
- Mobile-optimized admin navigation: The navigation bar in the Admin UI has been optimized for mobile devices, making it easier to manage your organization on the go.
- Default timezone visibility: When editing an area, the organization's default timezone is now displayed, helping you make informed decisions about area timezone settings.

**üìã More details**

As always, you can find detailed information about all recent releases and technical changes on our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/seatsurfing/seatsurfing/releases).
