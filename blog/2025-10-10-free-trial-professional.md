We're excited to announce that our Professional Plan is now available with a 30-day free trial. This means you can explore all the enterprise features that help growing teams manage desk sharing and space booking efficiently â€“ without any commitment.

Getting started with your 30-day trial is simple:

- **New to Seatsurfing?** [Simply sign up for a Professional Plan](/sign-up?paid) account and your trial begins immediately.
- **Already using Seatsurfing?** Existing users can activate the trial directly in the admin area under the "Subscription" section. No need to create a new account.

To continue using all Professional Plan features beyond the 30-day trial, admins need to subscribe before the trial period ends. If you choose not to subscribe, your account will automatically convert to the Free Plan after 30 days. You can continue using Seatsurfing at no cost with up to 10 users and access to a [limited features set](/features).
