In December we shipped a set of updates aimed at better usability, clearer admin controls, more transparency, and core stability improvements. Most changes came in the final week of the year, and all are available in the GitHub Releases history.

**🗓 Better Booking Experience**

* **Calendar view added to “My Bookings”:** Users now see their bookings in a calendar layout, making it easier to scan multiple dates and times.
* **Improved date/time picker:** The date/time selector across the UI now uses a refined Flatpickr implementation for smoother interactions.
* **Current filter shown in Admin Booking UI:** Admins get clearer context about what bookings are being displayed rather than guessing which filters are applied.

**📧 Email Transparency and Confirmations**

* **Email log introduced:** Admins can now track sent emails, improving visibility into system communications.
* **Confirmation mail for organization deletion:** When an org is deleted, a confirmation email will be sent — adding a safety feedback loop.
* **Improved email recipient names:** Emails now show clearer recipient details for better context.
* **Mail log callback fix for ACS:** Resolved an issue where the mail log wasn’t invoked when using Azure Communication Services (ACS).

**⚙️ Booking Rules & Admin Controls**

* **Recurring bookings toggle:** Admins can enable or disable recurring bookings via configuration, reducing unwanted repeats. 
* **Optional booking approver notifications:** You decide whether approvers get notified about new pending bookings.

**🧠 Clarity and Feedback in the UI**

* **Error improvement when booking in the past:** A clearer error code is provided if someone tries to create a booking in the past.
* **Show org language & primary contact on settings page:** Admin settings now surface organization language and main contact info.


**🔧 Bug Fixes and Dependency Hygiene**

December releases also included:

* Translation fixes (e.g., German strings).
* Dependency bumps across UI and backend modules to keep libraries up to date.
* Fix for panic when user/org deleted but token still valid.

These don’t change workflows directly but reduce friction and unexpected errors.

**What This Means for You**

* You get *more clarity* on your bookings and communications.
* Admins now have *tighter control* over rules like recurring booking and approver notifications.
* UX feels *more polished*, with fewer rough edges when selecting dates or managing filters.
