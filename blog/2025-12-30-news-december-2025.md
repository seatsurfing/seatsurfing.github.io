In December we shipped a set of updates aimed at better usability, clearer admin controls, more transparency, and core stability improvements. Most changes came in the final week of the year, and all are available in the GitHub Releases history.

**🗓 Better booking experience**

- **Calendar view added to “My Bookings”:** Users now see their bookings in a calendar layout, making it easier to scan multiple dates and times.
- **Improved date/time picker:** The date/time selectors across the UI were refined for smoother interactions.
- **Current filter in admin Booking UI:** Admins can now filter by current bookings to see who is in the office now.

**📧 Email transparency and confirmations**

- **Email log introduced:** Admins can now track sent emails, improving visibility into system communications.
- **Confirmation mail for organization deletion:** To delete an organization, a confirmation email is now sent to further protect the process from "deletions by mistake".
- **Improved email recipient names:** Emails now show clearer recipient details for better context.

**⚙️ Booking rules & admin controls**

- **Recurring bookings toggle:** Admins can enable or disable recurring bookings via configuration.
- **Optional booking approver notifications:** Approvers can now decide whether or not to get notified about new pending bookings.

**🧠 Clarity and feedback in the UI**

- **Error improvement when booking in the past:** A clearer error code is provided if someone tries to create a booking in the past.
- **Organizations details on admin settings page:** Admin settings now include organization details such as the main contact info.

**🔧 Bug fixes and dependency hygiene**

December releases also included:

- Translation fixes (e.g., German strings).
- Dependency bumps across UI and backend modules to keep libraries up to date.
- Fix for panic when user/org deleted but token still valid.

These don’t change workflows directly but reduce friction and unexpected errors.
