In January we shipped a set of updates focused on making the admin experience more powerful and tightening up security for self-hosted deployments. Here's what's new:

<!-- truncate -->

**🔍 Smarter booking filters in the admin interface**

Administrators can now filter bookings by individual users, making it much easier to track and manage bookings across your organization. In addition, we've introduced quick filters for "Today's Bookings" and "Current Bookings", so you can jump straight to what's relevant right now.

**🧾 Billing information in the admin interface**

Users on Seatsurfing's Paid plans can now manage their billing address directly within the admin interface.

**🗺️ SVG support for floor plans**

Room plans can now be uploaded in SVG format. SVG-based floor plans offer crisp, scalable visuals at any zoom level, giving your office layouts a cleaner and more professional look regardless of screen size or device.

**🔒 Security improvements for self-hosted instances**

We've made several security-related improvements. Organizations running their own Seatsurfing instances can now configure individual CORS headers and define a rate-limit to protect their instances.

**📋 More details**

As always, you can find detailed information about all recent releases and technical changes on our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/seatsurfing/seatsurfing/releases).
