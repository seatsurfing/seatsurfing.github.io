Many of you, our users, asked us for. Today, we are excited to finally announce the launch and immediate availability of our cloud-hosted Professional plan ðŸ¤©

The Professional plan includes all features known from the Open Source Edition of Seatsurfing, plus:

<ul class="fa-ul">
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i></span> Carefree Software as a Service (Saas) hosting on fast servers located in Germany</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i></span> As many users as you need (pay per user)</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i></span> Add your organization's custom domain to access your Seatsurfing instance</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i></span> 24/7 premium support</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i></span> Monthly payment</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i></span> &hellip;and there's more to come!</li>
</ul>

Of course, the Open Source Edition will still be the basis of the Professional plan. This is why you can expect regular updates, enhancements and new features.

Moreover, we will continue to provide the Cloud-hosted Free plan, which will remain cost-free for up to ten users. Perfectly suited to give Seatsurfing a try or to provide desk sharing, room reservations and other kinds of "space bookings" to small organizations.
