## FAQ

<div className="faq">

#### Can I switch betweens plans?

Yes, you can upgrade and downgrade at any time.

The Professional plan is paid upfront at the beginning of the subscription cycle. Changes in your user amount will be added to/subtracted from the invoice of the next subscription cycle.

#### Which payment types do you support?

Payment is handled by [Stripe](https://stripe.com). We accept payments by credit card, PayPal, SEPA Direct Debit, Apple Pay and Google Pay.
